# üì∞ Herald

A simple news website that requires the user to pay a subscription in order to view articles. It incorporates third-party services to handle content management, payments, and authentication.

This is a finalized proof-of-concept that was developed over the course of two weeks in December of 2022.

## üéØ Justification

This project does not address any practical problem, but it is an interesting proof-of-concepts and opportunity to work with several different third-party services to build a fully functional application. I wanted an opportunity to try different services to implement common use-cases such as content management, payments, backend as a service, and social authentication. Herald is an aggregator of such services, and a illustrates a concept on where you would implement all these services tofether.

In other words, I built Herald because I thought it could be an interesting challenge, not because it has some practical application to my life.
