# üì∞ Herald

A simple news website that requires the user to pay a subscription in order to view articles. It incorporates third-party services to handle content management, payments, and authentication.

This is a finalized proof-of-concept that was developed over the course of two weeks in December of 2022.

## üéØ Justification

This project does not address any practical problem, but it is an interesting proof-of-concepts and opportunity to work with several different third-party services to build a fully functional application. I wanted an opportunity to try different services to implement common use-cases such as content management, payments, backend as a service, and social authentication. Herald is an aggregator of such services, and a illustrates a concept on where you would implement all these services tofether.

In other words, I built Herald because I thought it could be an interesting challenge, not because it has some practical application to my life.

Next.js is the main engine of this project and the framework of choice for building an SSR web app in React + TypeScript. Supabase provides our underlying back-end with its nice relational cloud database. Stripe is our payment services, and Hygraph our CMS powered by GraphQL.

### Trade-offs Considered

For the BaaS (Backend as a Service) provider, the original choice was Firebase; however, due to the complexity in the docs and how difficult would be to model the data using the non-relational data and Firestore, Supabase proved to be a very efficient alternative with virtually no losses. This choice was essentially based on preference.

The CMS portion of this project was the last to be implemented. At first I thought it would be the simplest service to add, since I had no problems in leveraging Prismic as a headless CMS in the past. I was surprised by how much Prismic has changed over the past years and setting up a simple blog was a hassle. Their new flows are also imcompatible with pnpm, so I decided to try something new. The other options for more tradiotional headless CMS were either paid or self-hosted, so I landed on Hygraph with its simplistic UI and service. It is still a headless CMS but its contents are served over GraphQL instead of the typical REST used by CMS such as strapi, prismic, contentful, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

This project uses pnpm for dependency management. Follow the steps below to set up a local development environment.

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucasamonrc/herald.git
```

Navigate to the repository and install project dependencies:

```sh
cd herald
pnpm i
```

Copy the `example.env` to a new file named `.env.local`

```sh
cp example.env .env.local
```

You will need to set up your own project secrets to have all services working. Once you do you can start the project:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
